 title={Subgroup Identification Using the personalized Package},
 volume={98},
 url={https://www.jstatsoft.org/index.php/jss/article/view/v098i05},
 doi={10.18637/jss.v098.i05},
 abstract={A plethora of disparate statistical methods have been proposed for subgroup identification to help tailor treatment decisions for patients. However a majority of them do not have corresponding R packages and the few that do pertain to particular statistical methods or provide little means of evaluating whether meaningful subgroups have been found. Recently, the work of Chen, Tian, Cai, and Yu (2017) unified many of these subgroup identification methods into one general, consistent framework. The goal of the personalized package is to provide a corresponding unified software framework for subgroup identification analyses that provides not only estimation of subgroups, but evaluation of treatment effects within estimated subgroups. The personalized package allows for a variety of subgroup identification methods for many types of outcomes commonly encountered in medical settings. The package is built to incorporate the entire subgroup identification analysis pipeline including propensity score diagnostics, subgroup estimation, analysis of the treatment effects within subgroups, and evaluation of identified subgroups. In this framework, different methods can be accessed with little change in the analysis code. Similarly, new methods can easily be incorporated into the package. Besides familiar statistical models, the package also allows flexible machine learning tools to be leveraged in subgroup identification. Further estimation improvements can be obtained via efficiency augmentation.},

 abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},
