Identifying TEMs, exist, required comprehensive understanding intervention’s effect population. Traditional parametric modeling techniques, like generalized linear models (GLMs), define TEMs confounders non-zero confounder-treatment interaction terms. settings characterized time--event outcomes, Cox proportional hazards model can similarly used. Inference TEMs therefore possible stringent conditions data-generating process. (semi)parametric methods’ assumptions, like linearity confounder-outcome relationship linear model proportional hazards Cox model, violated, however, results invalid. flexible approaches instead focus estimating conditional average treatment effect (CATE) using interpretable modeling techniques, like LASSO (Tibshirani 1996; Tian et al. 2014; S. Chen et al. 2017; Q. Zhao, Small, Ertefaie 2018; Semenova Chernozhukov 2020; Bahamyirou et al. 2022) Random Forests (Breiman 2001; Wager Athey 2018; Cui et al. 2022). , however, methods require restrictive assumptions data-generating process, like sparsity treatment effect modification (P. Zhao Yu 2006), approximately uncorrelated confounders (P. Zhao Yu 2006; Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman 2009) sample sizes much larger number confounders (P. Zhao Yu 2006), reliably recover TEMs. Instead identifying TEMs indirectly modeling confounder-treatment-outcome relationship, recent work developed frameworks tailored task (Williamson et al. 2022; Boileau et al. 2022, 2025; Hines, Diaz-Ordaz, Vansteelandt 2022). Relying TEM variable importance parameters (TEM-VIP), possible assess confounders’ influence treatment effect nonparametric, algorithm-agnostic fashion largely avoids pitfalls parametric CATE-based methodologies. TEM-VIPs defined within nonparametric statistical models may augmented causal interpretations, permitting formal inference TEMs. unihtee R package implements recent proposals Boileau et al. (2022) Boileau et al. (2025). TEM-VIP framework relies parameters assess marginal effect confounder treatment effect heterogeneity, however treatment effect defined.
