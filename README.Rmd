`unihtee` provides tools for uncovering treatment effect modifiers in
high-dimensional data. Treatment effect modification is defined using variable
importance parameters based on absolute and relative effects. Inference is
performed about these variable importance measures using nonparametric
estimators. Users may use one-step or targeted maximum likelihood estimators.
Under general conditions, these estimators are unbiased and efficient.

Additional details about this methodology are provided in @boileau2022,
@boileau2023, and in the package's
[vignette](https://insightsengineering.github.io/unihtee/main/articles/using-unihtee.html).

## Installation

The package may be installed from GitHub using
[`remotes`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes):

```{r gh-master-installation, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("insightsengineering/unihtee")
```

`unihtee` is under active development. Check back often for updates.

## Usage

`unihtee()` is the only user-facing function. It can be used to perform
inference about the treatment effect modification variable importance
parameters. These parameters are defined for data-generating processes with
continuous, binary and time-to-event outcomes with binary exposure variables.
Variable importance parameters based on absolute and relative effects are
available. Details are provided in the vignette.

## Example

We simulate some observational study data that contains ten pre-treatment
covariates, of which are two treatment effect modifiers. We then perform
inference about the absolute treatment effect modifier variable importance
parameter, which is inspired by the average treatment effect.

```{r example}
library(unihtee)
library(MASS)
library(data.table)
library(sl3)

set.seed(510)

# create the dataset
n_obs <- 500
w <- mvrnorm(n = n_obs, mu = rep(0, 10), Sigma = diag(10))
confounder_names <- paste0("w_", seq_len(10))
colnames(w) <- confounder_names
a <- rbinom(n = n_obs, size = 1, prob = plogis(w[, 1] + w[, 2]))
y <- rnorm(n = n_obs, mean = w[, 1] + w[, 2] + a * w[, 3] - a * w[, 4])
dt <- as.data.table(cbind(w, a, y))

# targeted maximum likelihood estimates and testing procedure
unihtee_output <- unihtee(
  data = dt,
  confounders = confounder_names,
  modifiers = confounder_names,
  exposure = "a",
  outcome = "y",
  outcome_type = "continuous",
  effect = "absolute",
  estimator = "tmle"
)

# print table of estimated TEM-VIPs
unihtee_output$temvip_inference_tbl
```
